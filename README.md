Predicting who said it: Trump or Clinton
========================================

**By: Ignacio Chavarria ([@ignacio_chr][2])**

In this notebook, I use tf-idf scores and a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a tweet is more likely to have been tweeted by @realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton.

Ever wonder which candidate you tweet like? Follow these steps to find out:

 1. Fork this notebook (here or on [Kaggle][2])
 2. Replace the text string portion of the last cell with a personal tweet
 3. Run the notebook!

Test accuracy score: 93.66%
